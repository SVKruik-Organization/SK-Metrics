# SK Metrics

Welcome to SK Metrics, the mission control of SK Platform. It provides users with advanced in-depth real-time data on performance, traffic and much more. This data can be used to generate reports, analyse trends and to see if a third Raspberry is needed.

> NOTE: for now SK Metrics is used for an university assignment, so no SK Platform metrics at this time. Come back later for the full Houston experience.

Because a simple `README.md` can only do so much, I have also made an documentation platform, [SK Docs](https://platform.stefankruik.com/documentation). If you are serious about using my products, I highly recommend reading the relevant articles. Don't have time for that? Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://url.skpvt.io/r/support). I am always open to have a chat and answer questions to your heart's content, unless I am debugging deployment ðŸ˜„.
